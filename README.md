# delta-words

An implementation of the Delta Airlines "Letter Mix" game.

## Why?

For the last several years whenever I've had the opportunity 
to fly on Delta Airlines I have spent some time playing the
various games available on the in-flight monitor available 
to each passenger. One of the games that has traditionally 
been available is an anagram based game six, seemingly random 
letters are presented To the player. The player then uses 
those letters to try and form words. The more words, the 
player is able to form the higher, their score.

Each time I have played this game, I think: "I could write 
code to generate all possible words." 

Well, the last time I flew with Delta I was determined to 
get out my laptop and write some code to beat this game once 
and for all. Unfortunately, the game has been removed from
Delta's in-flight entertainment options. So, I decided to 
implement the game myself in this repo.
